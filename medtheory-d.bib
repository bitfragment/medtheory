	abstract = {This essay takes as axiomatic that the subject of new media – which in other contexts we call the user, the reader, the writer (or in institutional contexts, the researcher, the teacher, the student…) – is a subject of language. This subject’s engagements with media and, by way of media, with other subjects, are determined by relations founded on language which French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan terms the social bond of discourse.

I propose that modes of critical engagement and teaching in the contemporary digital field, particularly as the field shifts towards a more unified disciplinarity and a more secure institutional footing, can be described in relation to the graphs of Lacan’s "four discourses" – of the University, Master, Hysteric, and Analyst. I conclude that deliberate reflection on structures of our research and pedagogy, mapped by the graphs, may lead us beyond the confidence games of the master and the University – on and by which our inquiries are founded and oriented, but also narrowed – to the side of the hysteric and the analyst, whose collaborations are more productive of new forms of knowledge.},

	abstract = {This volume examines the evolving role of the Internet in activism, dissent, and authoritarian regimes. The author investigates the impact of a range of media on social revolution and activism from television in East Germany to Twitter during Iran's Green Revolution, intertwining that analysis with discussion of the ways governments are able to use the Internet for surveillance of political activity, propaganda dissemination, and censorship. He analyzes the effect of the proliferation of available entertainment and access to consumer goods on the potential for political activity, arguing that opening societies to further consumerism and to Western cultural media has in some ways deterred political activism. The author's argument that the West conflates democratization with consumerism uncovers a critique of the West here for its complacent belief that the Internet and supposed freedom of information is a certain pathway to democratization.},

Even as some observers hail the digital humanities as a savior of humanistic disciplines in crisis, critical questions about its nature and potential remain unanswered. The contributors to this special issue explicitly critique and engage the digital humanities, rather than simply celebrating the still-emerging field. This collection brings together scholars from the center of digital humanities initiatives and from the closely related fields of new media and software studies, among others, to interrogate some of the assumptions and elisions at play in previous discussions of the digital humanities and assess their impact on the humanities and the university at large. Topics include the national security state; games and “gamification”; the funding crisis in higher education and {MOOCs}; and issues of race, gender, and class marginalization in digital humanities research.},

New technologies and genres of downward communication, upward reporting, and internal correspondence were introduced to enhance control through communication. The office became an “innovation junction” of technologies, creating new functions and a new office hierarchy that was reflected in office buildings, lay-out, and furnishing. Technology was an enabling and promoting actor, but not the primary cause of innovation. Committed managers played an important role in introducing new communication technologies. National and international networks of records management specialists and providers of office technologies were equally important. Recognition of the history of control through communication may contribute to understanding current and future adaptation and innovation of record-keeping technologies in their social and cultural contexts.},
