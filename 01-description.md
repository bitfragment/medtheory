A close and careful reading of major works of media theory understood as a branch of modernity theory, in liaison with questions of literariness and literary study. We'll begin with the work of Harold Innis and Marshall McLuhan, as an effort to "unthink" Euro-Atlantic modernity, or shift it into reverse. Subsequently, we'll examine the extension and refinement of McLuhan's project in the writings of Walter Ong, Elizabeth Eisenstein, Friedrich A. Kittler, and Vil√©m Flusser. If this array of "masocritical" conflict can be said to mark the struggle of Euro-Atlantic modernity with itself, can it point us to work to be done without its episteme?
