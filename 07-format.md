* One or two members will prepare a response to the position papers.
* Before our meeting, these responses will be added to the wiki, as comments on the position paper.
* These responses will also be verbally presented during our meeting.
* To ensure both informed and engaged participation in discussion by every member of the seminar, everyone else will have made a 350-word contribution to a collectively authored note set (also on the wiki) on the A-level reading(s) for the session.

After our reading sessions are complete, we'll determine a schedule for the sessions that remain.
