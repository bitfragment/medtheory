1. Each week, a 350-word contribution to a collectively authored wiki [note set]({{site.baseurl}}/10-notes-assigns) on a concept in the A-level reading for that week's session, to be completed no later than 12 hours before our weekly seminar meeting, except when you are delivering a position or response paper (in which case the latter is your only assignment for the session). You are free to skip *one* of these weekly assignments without effect on my evaluation of your performance.

1. One 750-word position paper on an A-level reading, to be prepared, posted in the wiki (simply edit the appropriate child page under [Position papers]({{ site.wiki}}/Position+papers)) no later than 36 hours before our weekly seminar meeting, and verbally presented during that seminar meeting.

1. One 500-word response, as designated respondent to a position paper. To be prepared, posted *as a comment on the position paper* no later than 12 hours before our weekly seminar meeting, and verbally presented during that seminar meeting.

1. After the conclusion of our reading sessions, substantive and proportionate contributions to a collectively authored textbook-style working paper (written using the child pages of the wiki page [Working paper]({{ site.wiki }}/Working+paper), first; subsequently, edited using our [sites.psu.edu site]({{ site.blog }}) equipped with the CommentPress plugin) that will preserve our discussions for future use in your comprehensive exam preparation and dissertation planning.

1. A brief abstract serving to introduce one of the major divisions of this collectively authored working paper.
