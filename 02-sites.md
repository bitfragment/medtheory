I recommend that you use the Yammer group page as a starting point for accessing the various course sites and resources, since I've reproduced these links there as well. I recommend that you also bookmark them.

* Private [PSU Yammer group]({{ site.yammer }}) for announcements, public discussion of course logistics, etc.
* [Calendly page]({{ site.calendar }}) for requesting appointments with me
* Public [course syllabus]({{ site.url }}) â€” *you are here!*
* Private [PDF repository]({{ site.repo-pdf }}) of course readings
* Public [Zotero collection]({{ site.zotero }}) of course readings
* [Pinboard tag]({{ site.pinboard }}) for related resources not yet integrated into the Zotero collection and syllabus
* Private [PSU Confluence Wikispace]({{ site.wiki }}) for weekly work and the first part of our final working paper
* Private [sites.psu.edu]({{ site.blog }}) site for the last part of our final working paper
