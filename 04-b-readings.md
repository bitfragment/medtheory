Optional for the first eight sessions. But I recommended that you try work through at least one of these per session, during the first eight sessions, chosen according to your taste, interests, and needs. Some directly illuminate, others obliquely supplement our A-level readings, suggesting missing spatial and/or temporal perspectives (e.g.: race and ethnicity; gender and sexuality; geographic and geopolitical space).
